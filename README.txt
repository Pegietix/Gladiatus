___________________________________

This is a first big project of mine - estimate it on 300+ hours of work to complete it.
I am nowhere near the end (maybe like 10% completed) and I already would write it much better, 
so I treat this code just as kind of prototype.

TODO:
- serious refactors needed (especially "DRY"-related, function names)
- GUI
- adding a plethora of badass functions and mechanisms
